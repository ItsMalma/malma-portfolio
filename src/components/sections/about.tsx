					Hi! I'm Adam Akmal Madani, you can call me Adam or Malma. I'm a
					Software Engineer who started learning software engineering back in
					2019, and I've been exploring this field for over seven years now. I
					currently have around three years of professional experience, mostly
					working as a web developer.
				</p>
				<p className="text-lg font-medium tracking-wide wrap-break-word hyphens-auto">
					I'm skilled in a variety of technologies, especially those related to
					web development and low-level programming. Some of the tools and
					languages I work with include TypeScript, React, Go, C, PostgreSQL,
					Git, Linux, CI/CD, etc.
				</p>
				<p className="text-lg font-medium tracking-wide wrap-break-word hyphens-auto">
					I really enjoy creating applications that make a meaningful impact. I
					also love experimenting with older technologies, there's something
					charming about understanding how things used to work. Outside of
					coding, I also like to spend my time writing, whether it's about tech
					or personal thoughts.
				</p>
				<p className="text-lg font-medium tracking-wide wrap-break-word hyphens-auto">
					For me, building something useful and thoughtful is what keeps me
					excited every day, and I'm always happy to keep learning and growing.
